/* 
	Note:
		+ Mixin names should describe what things ARE, not what they look like.
		+ As much as it kills me, colour is spelled the American way to be consistant
		  with colour declarations in css.
	
	For example, the following are good variable names:
	$font-base, $font-header, $color-brand, $color-accent, $breakpoint-midsize, $breakpoint-small
	
	These are bad variable names:
	$blue, $orange, $helvetica, $ipad, $iphone
	
	On naming conventions, a good convention is to use underscores for spaces, and dashes to indicate
	a subsidiary relationship. This allows you to easily group variables by type.
	
	The following are good examples of variable groups named with a dash to indicate descendency:
	
	$font-x
	$font_weight-x
	$color-x
	$icon-x
	$breakpoint-x
